# DSA Codes
This repository contains Java solutions to various DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) problems. The solutions provided in this repository may not be the most optimized ones but they will provide a starting point for beginners to get a grasp of the problems.

It is recommended that the viewers first try to solve the problems on their own by practicing on websites such as https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/smart-interviews-basic/challenges  (https://github.com/utk145/Hackerrank-smart-interviews-SI-Basic) before referring to these solutions. By practicing first and only referring to the solutions as a last resort, viewers will be able to improve their problem solving skills and get a better understanding of the concepts involved.

The file names are the names of the problems. Some codes are well commented to explain the approach used to solve the problem.

## Language Selection
While this repository mainly contains Java solutions, I suggest viewers to choose a single programming language (preferably Java or C++) to solve the problems thoroughly. Choosing a language to focus on can help to improve your proficiency in that particular language.

## Disclaimer
The solutions in this repository are not intended for copying and pasting into online judges or contests. This repository is for educational purposes only and is meant to be used as a reference to understand the concepts behind the problems.
